                <p>
                  Primary Shredders use rotating blades, cutters, or granulators to reduce materials into uniform sizes. Adjustable settings
                  allow precise control over output size, speed, and torque, optimizing operations for plastics, rubber, metals, paper, and e-waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Integration with conveyors, balers, and automated sorting systems ensures continuous, smooth workflow for downstream processing.
